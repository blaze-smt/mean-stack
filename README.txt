//Title//
Blaze Smith MEAN Stack Porfolio


//Description//
This is my first full stack application.

We had to utilize the MEAN stack to achieve this so my front-end is created
with Angular 13 and my backend consists of Node, Express.js, and MongoDB.

This is an earlier version of my portfolio so don't take the actual content
on the application seriously. I created this portfolio over winter break just
for something to do. There will be a final a much better portfolio at the end
of the Spring 2022 semester.

This project took a lot of trouble shooting and extra learning but I am very happy
with the end result. My main critique would be to have a cleaner file system in place.
I tried to use the horizontal system as best as I could. Also using git wasn't a requirement
for this so my branches and commits have big gaps in between.


//Guide//
-open the application root folder in terminal/cmd
-type 'npm start'
-open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
